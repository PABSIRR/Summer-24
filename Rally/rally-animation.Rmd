# Exploring the Court

With this dataset giving very precise coordinates for the event data, it would be insane not to try to plot that data on an actual court! 
Lucky for us, the dataset owner has published the fitting coordinates in the first kernel, which means we can create a tennis court quite easily with `ggplot`:

```{r out.width='100%', out.height='auto', warning=FALSE}

out_bounds <- data.frame(
    x = c(-455, -455, 455, 455, -455),
    y = c(-210, 210, 210, -210, -210)
)

t_lines <- data.frame(
    x = c(-245, -245, -245, 245, 245, 245),
    y = c(-157.5, 157.5, 0, 0, -157.5, 157.5)
)

# Left is nearside, right is farside
court <- ggplot() +
    geom_path(data = out_bounds, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
    geom_path(data = t_lines, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
    geom_path(aes(x = c(-455, 455), y = c(-157, -157))) + # lower singles lines
    geom_path(aes(x = c(-455, 455), y = c(157, 157))) + # upper singles lines
    geom_path(aes(x = c(0, 0), y = c(-240, 240))) + # net line
    geom_path(aes(x = c(-455, -445), y = c(0, 0))) + # left hash line
    geom_path(aes(x = c(445, 455), y = c(0, 0))) + # right hash line
    ylim(c(-400, 400)) + xlim(c(-700, 700)) + 
    theme_void()

court
```

All good, except that the axes here are swapped in comparison to the original format, which means we'll have to do a quick adjustment of the columnnames. 

```{r}
events <- events %>%
    rename(hitter_x = hitter_y,
           hitter_y = hitter_x,
           receiver_x = receiver_y,
           receiver_y = receiver_x)

points <- points %>%
    rename(hitter_x = hitter_y,
           hitter_y = hitter_x,
           receiver_x = receiver_y,
           receiver_y = receiver_x)

serves <- serves %>%
    rename(y = x,
           x = y)
```

With the key variables being switched - or the coordinates transposed, if you wish - we can start to visualize data on the aforementioned court!

```{r out.width='100%', out.height='auto', warning=FALSE}
court +
    geom_point(data = events,
             aes(x = hitter_x, y = hitter_y, colour = hitter)) +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom", 
          plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
    ggtitle("Hitter Positions")
```

This graphic gives a general idea about where the game is "taking place" on the court, as it shows where the ball was hit by a player.

The following graphic shows us from where a winner was hit:

```{r out.width='100%', out.height='auto', warning=FALSE}
winners <- points %>%
    filter(isWinner == 1.0)

court +
    geom_point(data = winners, aes(x = hitter_x, y = hitter_y, colour = pointWonBy)) +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom",
          plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
    ggtitle("Winner Positions")

```

## Animating the Serve

First of, let's take a look at serves! 
I'm interested in the travel path of a ball from the server to the returner, so let's create an animated plot of serves to the returner.
Before we can create that animations, we've got some reshaping to do.
We will need to replace the receiver coordinates from the `serves` table, because we are actually interested in the location of the receiver when he returns the serves, not where he stands on the serve!

Additionally, we'll melt the data.frame in which the three points of interests build one observation, so that we create a `3 x 2` matrix for each rally.

```{r}
tmp <- events %>% 
    filter(strokeid == 1) %>% 
    select(rallyid, receiver, hitter_x, hitter_y, receiver_x, receiver_y) %>% 
    right_join(serves, by = "rallyid")


 # The next two assignments take care of only including serves with a return
sec_stroke <- events %>% 
    filter(strokeid == 2) %>% 
    rename(return_x = hitter_x, return_y = hitter_y) %>% 
    select(rallyid, return_y, return_x)

tmp <-  tmp %>% inner_join(sec_stroke, by = "rallyid") %>% 
    mutate(
        receiver_x = return_x,
        receiver_y = return_y
    ) %>% 
    select(-return_y, -return_x)

 # We start melting the frames to create coordinate matrices for each rally
tmp_mx <- tmp %>%
    rename(hitter = hitter_x,
           coord = x,
           receive = receiver_x) %>% 
    melt(id.vars = c("rallyid", "server", "receiver"),
         measure.vars = c("hitter", "coord", "receive")
    ) %>% 
    rename(x_kind = variable,
           x = value)

tmp_my <- tmp %>%
    rename(hitter = hitter_y,
           coord = y,
           receive = receiver_y) %>% 
    melt(id.vars = c("rallyid", "server", "receiver"),
         measure.vars = c("hitter", "coord", "receive")
    ) %>% 
    rename(y_kind = variable,
           y = value)

df <- inner_join(tmp_mx, tmp_my[, c("rallyid", "y_kind", "y")], by = c("rallyid", "x_kind" = "y_kind"))
```

Now we can take a first look at the service game!

```{r out.width='100%', out.height='auto'}
serve_p <- court +
    geom_path(data = df, aes(x = x, y = y, group = rallyid, color = server)) +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom",
          plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
    ggtitle("Serve Direction")

serve_p
```

This is quite messy, which is unsurprising. 
Can we make this a little more clearer, perhaps with points?

```{r out.width='100%', out.height='auto'}
serve_p +
    geom_point(data = df, aes(x = x, y = y, group = rallyid, color = server))
```

Well, the answer is no. The plot is too busy and actually wants to tell a story, rather than just painting this picture.
Let's get that story out!

```{r out.width='100%', out.height='auto'}
df <- arrange(df, rallyid)
df$index <- 1:nrow(df)

gif <- court +
    geom_path(data = df, aes(x = x, y = y, group = rallyid, color = server)) +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom",
          plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
    ggtitle("Serve Direction") +
    geom_point(data = df, aes(x = x, y = y, group = rallyid, color = server)) +
    transition_reveal(index)

# animate(gif, nframes = nrow(df)*3)
```

## Animating Rallies

If we want to replay certain points, we'll have to rearrange the events dataset. 
Below, we use `melt()` twice again, to get a matrix of positions for a given rallyid, its dimensions depending on the number of strokes in the rally. 
As an example: If we want to have every position of the ball for the first rally - which had three strokes in it - the dimensions would be `3 x 2` again.

```{r}
ball_x <- events %>%
    melt(id.vars = c("rallyid", "strokeid", "hitter", "receiver"),
         measure.vars = c("hitter_x")
    ) %>%
    rename(x_kind = variable,
           x = value)
ball_y <- events %>%
    melt(id.vars = c("rallyid", "strokeid", "hitter", "receiver"),
         measure.vars = c("hitter_y")
    ) %>%
    rename(y_kind = variable,
           y = value)

ball_pos <- inner_join(ball_x, ball_y[, c("rallyid", "strokeid", "y")], by = c("rallyid", "strokeid"))

kable(head(arrange(ball_pos, rallyid)))
```

With the matrix done again, we'll set up the ggplot object we want to animate. 
However, before we do that, we'll repaint our court in the classic Australian Open style.

```{r out.width='100%', out.height='auto'}
court_b <- ggplot() +
    geom_path(data = out_bounds, aes(x = x, y = y), colour = "white", size = 1.5, lineend = "square") +
    geom_path(data = t_lines, aes(x = x, y = y), colour = "white", size = 1.5, lineend = "square") +
    geom_path(aes(x = c(-455, 455), y = c(-157, -157)), colour = "white", size = 1.5, lineend = "square") + # lower singles lines
    geom_path(aes(x = c(-455, 455), y = c(157, 157)), colour = "white", size = 1.5, lineend = "square") + # upper singles lines
    geom_path(aes(x = c(0, 0), y = c(-240, 240)), lty = 1, colour = "white", size = 1.5, lineend = "square") + # net line
    ylim(c(-400, 400)) + xlim(c(-700, 700)) +
    theme_void() +
    theme(
        plot.background = element_rect("#5080B0")
    )
court_b
```

With this out of the way, let us check the hits out again, not animated.

```{r out.width='100%', out.height='auto'}
court_b +
    geom_point(data = ball_pos, aes(x = x, y = y), colour = "yellow")
```

This seems very familiar to the static plots we have started with, but that is obviously not what we want. 
We want to replay points! And to do that, we'll need to check out which points we want those to be. 
Let's do an example with a long rally. 

```{r out.width='100%', out.height='auto'}
ani_df <- ball_pos %>%
    filter(rallyid == 120)

rally_points <- court_b +
    geom_point(data = ani_df, aes(x = x, y = y), colour = "yellow")

rally_lines <- court_b +
    geom_point(data = ani_df, aes(x = x, y = y), colour = "yellow") +
    geom_path(data = ani_df, aes(x = x, y = y), colour = "yellow")



rally_points
rally_lines
```

Animating the ball movements from here is a piece of cake!
First, we'll animate the lower graph, because it allows us to follow the past of the exchange better.

```{r out.width='100%', out.height='auto'}
gif_lines <- rally_lines +
    transition_reveal(strokeid)

gif_lines
```
<center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/W646cKX1jTejKio4nc/giphy.gif"></center>

Like this we can analyze the way the players handled their positioning, and basically where they hit the ball. 
In the next section, we'll try to make the rally look more like a replay!

## Creating the Replay Engine

If we want to have an `R`-based replay engine, we could go with the following route:

```{r out.width='100%', out.height='auto', warning=FALSE}
gif_ball <- court_b +
    geom_point(data = ani_df, aes(x = x, y = y), colour = "yellow") +
    geom_path(data = ani_df, aes(x = x, y = y), colour = NA) +
    transition_reveal(strokeid)

animate(gif_ball, nframes = 200)
```
<center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/cIh29hWEvP9pTm9nGb/giphy.gif"></center>

This gives us the base for replaying points. The next steps are to add the relevant player on each side, so that we can follow the replay more closely.
Lucky us, that information is available from the events to! We'll need to interpolate between hits for each player. Let's give that a try!

```{r}
# First, create new variables for the positions
base <- ball_pos %>%
    mutate(
        wagle_x = ifelse(hitter == "Elise Wagle", x, NA),
        wagle_y = ifelse(hitter == "Elise Wagle", y, NA),
        komac_x = ifelse(hitter == "Motka Komac", x, NA),
        komac_y = ifelse(hitter == "Motka Komac", y, NA)
        )

# Fill the new variables with starting positions for the return player
base <- base %>%
    left_join(events[c("rallyid", "strokeid", "receiver_x", "receiver_y")], by = c("rallyid", "strokeid")) %>%
    mutate(
        wagle_x = ifelse((strokeid == 1 & receiver == "Elise Wagle"), receiver_x, wagle_x),
        wagle_y = ifelse(strokeid == 1 & receiver == "Elise Wagle", receiver_y, wagle_y),
        komac_x = ifelse(strokeid == 1 & receiver == "Motka Komac", receiver_x, komac_x),
        komac_y = ifelse(strokeid == 1 & receiver == "Motka Komac", receiver_y, komac_y)
    ) %>%
    select(-receiver_x, -receiver_y)


# Fill the new variables with the end positions of a rally
base <- base %>%
    group_by(rallyid) %>%
    mutate(
        wagle_x = ifelse(strokeid == max(strokeid) & strokeid != 1 & receiver == "Elise Wagle",
                         wagle_x[strokeid == max(strokeid) - 1],
                         wagle_x),
        wagle_y = ifelse(strokeid == max(strokeid) & strokeid != 1 & receiver == "Elise Wagle",
                         wagle_y[strokeid == max(strokeid) - 1],
                         wagle_y),
        komac_x = ifelse(strokeid == max(strokeid) & strokeid != 1 & receiver == "Motka Komac",
                       komac_x[strokeid == max(strokeid) - 1],
                       komac_x),
        komac_y = ifelse(strokeid == max(strokeid) & strokeid != 1 & receiver == "Motka Komac",
                       komac_y[strokeid == max(strokeid) - 1],
                       komac_y),
    )

# Interpolate between the respective hits
base <- base %>%
    group_by(rallyid) %>%
    mutate(
        wagle_x = ifelse(is.na(wagle_x), (lag(wagle_x) + lead(wagle_x))/2, wagle_x),
        wagle_y = ifelse(is.na(wagle_y), (lag(wagle_y) + lead(wagle_y))/2, wagle_y),
        komac_x = ifelse(is.na(komac_x), (lag(komac_x) + lead(komac_x))/2, komac_x),
        komac_y = ifelse(is.na(komac_y), (lag(komac_y) + lead(komac_y))/2, komac_y)
    )

base <- base %>%
    left_join(points[, c("rallyid", "score")], by = "rallyid") %>%
    filter(!is.na("score"))

```

Now we've got a table holding all information we could ask for (right now).
We know the position of the ball and the position of the players, meaning we can animate a replay! 

For comparison's sake, we'll go with the same example as before!

```{r out.width='100%', out.height='auto', warning=FALSE}
ani_df <- base %>% filter(rallyid == 15)

gif_replay <- court_b +
    # ball
    geom_point(data = ani_df, aes(x = x, y = y), colour = "yellow", size = 3) +
    geom_path(data = ani_df, aes(x = x, y = y), colour = NA) +
    # Wagle
    # geom_point(data = ani_df, aes(x = wagle_x, y = wagle_y), size = 8, col = "orange") +
    # geom_text(data = ani_df, aes(x = wagle_x, y = wagle_y, label = "W")) +
    # Komac
    # geom_point(data = ani_df, aes(x = komac_x, y = komac_y), size = 8, col = "white") +
    # geom_text(data = ani_df, aes(x = komac_x, y = komac_y, label = "K")) +
    transition_reveal(strokeid)

# animate(gif_replay, nframes = 240, fps = 40)
```

## HUD

Adding some kind of a HUD is a pretty easy addition, as you can see below:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# score <- ani_df[1, "score"]
# serve <- ani_df[1, "hitter"]
# 
# gif_hud <- court_b +
#     ylim(c(-1, 14)) +
#     geom_text(aes(x = 2, y = 13.5, label = paste0("Score: ", score)), color = "white") +
#     geom_text(aes(x = 2, y = 12.5, label = paste0("Serve: ", serve)), color = "white") +
#     #geom_text(data = ani_df, aes(x = 6, y = 13.5, label = round(strokenum)), color = "white") +
#      # ball
#     geom_point(data = ani_df, aes(x = x, y = y), colour = "yellow", size = 3) +
#     geom_path(data = ani_df, aes(x = x, y = y), colour = NA) +     
#     # nadal
#     geom_point(data = ani_df, aes(x = wagle_x, y = wagle_y), size = 8, col = "orange") + 
#     geom_text(data = ani_df, aes(x = wagle_x, y = wagle_y, label = "N")) +
#     # djokovic
#     geom_point(data = ani_df, aes(x = komac_x, y = komac_y), size = 8, col = "white") +
#     geom_text(data = ani_df, aes(x = komac_x, y = komac_y, label = "D")) +
#     transition_reveal(strokeid)
# 
# #animate(gif_hud, nframes = 200, fps = 20)    
```
